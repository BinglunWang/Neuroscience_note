## 1. Decoding cognition from spontaneous neural activity 
[Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2022, Liu et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-022-00570-z)

Motivation: 
A large proportion of variance in neural activity is off-task. The 'spontaneous' refers to intrinsic activities mere response to external events. This review focus on this point.
