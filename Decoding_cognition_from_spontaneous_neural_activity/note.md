## Motivation: 
A large proportion of variance in neural activity is off-task. The 'spontaneous' refers to intrinsic activities mere response to external events. This review focus on this point.

## A dichotomy in human neuroscience

### standard approach
align neural activity to specific task events, and to localize the corresponding neural response in the brain. 

### spontaneous neural activity
1. data-driven approach focus on intrinsic physiological features. The features are inferred or evaluated by task-evoked activity patterns reported in other studies.
Drawbacks: data-driven approaches are not as well positioned to provide a cognitive grounding because a direct relationship to task events cannot be assumed.

2. Intervention-based approach enables direct inference with respect to the underlying cognitive process. This benefit, however, comes at the expense of interrupting internal computations that are ‘spontaneous’ in nature, such as imagination or mind wandering —  processes that are by definition not tied to immediate task demand.

3. ‘representation- rich' approach combine these two advantages. It is predicated on an assumption that the same neural representations of task events (for example, ‘house’ or ‘apple’) are active both on- task and off- task.
