## Motivation: 
A large proportion of variance in neural activity is off-task. The 'spontaneous' refers to intrinsic activities mere response to external events. This review focus on this point.

## A dichotomy in human neuroscience

### standard approach
align neural activity to specific task events, and to localize the corresponding neural response in the brain. 

### spontaneous neural activity
1. data-driven approach focus on intrinsic physiological features. The features are inferred or evaluated by task-evoked activity patterns reported in other studies.
Drawbacks: data-driven approaches are not as well positioned to provide a cognitive grounding because a direct relationship to task events cannot be assumed.

测量数据，直接利用数据的分类器来探索发现。

2. Intervention-based approach enables direct inference with respect to the underlying cognitive process. This benefit, however, comes at the expense of interrupting internal computations that are ‘spontaneous’ in nature, such as imagination or mind wandering —  processes that are by definition not tied to immediate task demand.

尝试让被试在被动的情况下被打扰，比如想要测量被试看到树的非视觉反应。

我们可以先给被试看树的时候给予一个音乐，然后让被试听到音乐的时候会联想到树。
这个时候在被试睡着的时候，播放音乐，让被试在潜意识下被影响。这时候检测脑部信号，从而观测到非视觉反应。



3. ‘representation- rich' approach combine these two advantages. It is predicated on an assumption that the same neural representations of task events (for example, ‘house’ or ‘apple’) are active both on- task and off- task.

Such representations can first be derived from task- evoked neural activity and their reactivations can subsequently be obtained through decoding. 


监督spontaneous的信号数据，然后测试信号。当发现信号有和task-base有高相似的结果的时候。这个时候来看

Question
问这三个为什么要放在一起分类，这三个任务并不是对同样任务可以使用的不同方法，这三个方法甚至所做的任务不同。
